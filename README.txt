Project Gallery

Shaughn Anderson

With this project I wanted to make a website that displayed what I had learned so far and organized it in a ledgible way.I also wanted a way to display projects I would work on in the future and to have a space for those.

The Requirements for this project were as follows
Have a section or card for each project
Each card should have a title, an image of your project, and a description
Use flexbox to arrange the cards on the page
Resize cards based on screen width
Adapt the layout of the gallery when the browser window resizes
Display the cards in a single column on mobile devices
Have a clickable button on each card that opens and closes the description text


Learning Flexbox really pushed me in terms of what can be done with css. It added a lot of complexity to what I had learned in the preivious assignment. Although I dont know if front end development is a thing I am interested in I can see that there are a lot of complexities within it that I would not have anticipated. Getting something to display functionally on all size screens and windows is a lot more complex than I would have thought going in. I have come out of this project with a decent idea how to handle it though.

The hide and display text buttons were a good way to expand on my Java knowledge I was able to build them from what I learned in the MDN intro to java script page although from things I have learned on future projects there were deffinetly better ways I could have coded them than how I handled it in my first pass.
